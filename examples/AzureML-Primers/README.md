## Azure Machine Learning Primers

This project contains a series of notebooks that are designed to help data scientists become familiar with the key concepts and patterns used in Azure Machine Learning. The project has been designed as an end-to-end learning path that anyone with existing knowledge of training machine learning models with Python can follow to learn how Azure ML works. The learning path introduces the core concepts as a logical progression of samples that build on one another to introduce more advanced concepts and techniques.

We've deliberately used the same simple example data, and a basic Scikit-Learn classification model throughout the project. This helps keep the examples consistent, and avoids over-complicating the machine learning aspects of the code, so that you can focus on the Azure ML concepts and tasks. The same principles used throughout the examples apply to more complex modeling scenarios, such as building deep learning models with frameworks like PyTorch or Keras.

Enjoy!
